# Advent Of Code 2021
My solutions for Advent of Code 2021, written in PHP!

## 🎄 Merry Christmas🎄

It's that time of year again, Santa 🎅 is in trouble and the elves needs our help to save Christmas. For such an
important task we need the utmost in reliability and performance so I will be using PHP to do my
part. So get ready to `.unwrap()` those 🎁 to save Christmas and don't `panic!()`.
